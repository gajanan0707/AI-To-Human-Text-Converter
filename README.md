# AI To Human Text Converter

Welcome to the **AI To Human Text Converter** project! This project is designed to take AI-generated text and transform it into more human-like language using natural language processing techniques. It replaces certain words with appropriate synonyms and lightly restructures sentences to enhance readability and comprehension.

## Project Features:

- Sentence restructuring for improved flow
- Customizable with NLP (SpaCy) and WordNet libraries

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- SpaCy
- WordNet (NLTK)

## Installation:
